# VDI
Repository for VDI scripts

This script is currently designed for Windows 10 Enterprise installations only - this has only been tested on Enterprise, and as such it is not guaranteed to work on Pro, Home, Education, LTSB, or any other variant of Windows 10.  If you want to try, remove the version check at the beginning of the script.  As always, this is as-is - if you break it, you get to keep the pieces.
